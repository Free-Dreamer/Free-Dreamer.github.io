LeetCode 1688. Count of Matches in Tournament

# 1688. Count of Matches in Tournament

## Question

You are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.

- If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.

Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.

- Constraints
  - `1 <= n <= 200`

## Solution

- 简单while: 36ms / 14.8M (81.28% / 43.01%)

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfMatches(self, n: int) -> int:
        matches = 0
        while (n != 1):
            matches += n // 2
            n = (n // 2) + (n % 2)
        return matches
```
